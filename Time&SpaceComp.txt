                                                        Time Complexity Analysis

All stack operations have a time Complexity of O(1).

                                                        Space Complexity Analysis

A structure has an integer array of size 1000 -> O(1000) i.e O(1) (constant space) and an integer top -> O(1).
So Overall Space Complexity -> O(1).
