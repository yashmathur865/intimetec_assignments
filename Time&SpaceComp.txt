                                                        Time Complexity

Push (push)	O(N)
Enqueue element into q1 → O(1)
Move all elements from q1 to q2 → O(N)
Swap q1 and q2 → O(1)
Overall Complexity: O(N)


Pop (pop)	O(1)
Peek (peekStack)	O(1)
isStackEmpty	O(1)
stackSize	O(1)

                                                        Space Complexity

The space required for both queues:
Each queue has a max size of MAX_SIZE → O(N)

Overall Space Complexity: O(N)
