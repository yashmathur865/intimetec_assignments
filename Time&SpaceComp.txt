                                                        Time Complexity

initStack, initQueue -> O(1)
isEmpty, isFull, size, isQueueEmpty, queueSize -> O(1)
push, enqueue -> O(1)
pop -> O(1)
dequeue -> O(N) (as it transfers elements to a temporary stack and back)
peek, peekQueue -> O(N) (similar to dequeue, requires element transfers)

                                                        Space Complexity

O(N) (since an extra stack is used during dequeue operations)
